/*Given an array arr of size n, the task is to check if the given array can be a level order representation of a Max Heap.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2}
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
The given array represents below tree
       90
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
7    12  2
The tree follows max-heap property as every
node is greater than all of its descendants.
Example 2:
Input:  
n = 6
arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11}
Output:
0
Explanation:
The given array represents below tree
       9
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
7    12  11
The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is
smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11. 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isMaxHeap() which takes the array arr[] and its size n as inputs and returns True if the given array could represent a valid level order representation of a Max Heap, or else, it will return False.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
